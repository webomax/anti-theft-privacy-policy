**Last updated: February 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how **Webomax Bilisim Teknolojileri Limited Sirketi** (“Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information in connection with the Anti-Theft Alarm mobile application (the “App”).

By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

 

## 1. Overview

The Anti-Theft Alarm App is designed to help deter unauthorized handling of your mobile device by triggering an alarm when motion or touch is detected.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The App is designed to function primarily on your device and does not require account creation.

 

## 2. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Information

We do **not** collect, store, or sell personal information such as:

* Name
* Email address
* Phone number
* Contacts
* Messages
* Photos
* Location data (unless explicitly stated and enabled by you)

The App operates locally on your device.

 

### B. Device Permissions

The App may request access to certain device features strictly for functionality purposes:

* **Motion Sensors / Device Sensors** – to detect movement or touch
* **Notifications** – to inform you when protection is active
* **Audio / Speaker Access** – to play alarm sounds
* **Vibration** – to enhance alarm alerts
* **Foreground Service (Android)** – to keep protection active while the app runs in the background

These permissions are used solely to provide the core anti-theft functionality. No sensor data is transmitted to our servers.

 

### C. Advertising Data (AdMob)

The free version of the App may display advertisements provided by third-party advertising networks such as **Google AdMob**.

AdMob may collect certain information automatically, which may include:

* Device identifiers
* Advertising ID
* IP address
* Device type
* Operating system
* Interaction with advertisements

This data is collected and processed directly by Google in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy. We do not control or store this data.

You can learn more about Google’s data practices in Google’s Privacy Policy.

 

### D. In-App Purchases (RevenueCat & App Stores)

The App offers a one-time purchase to unlock premium features.

Payments are processed securely by:

* Apple App Store
* Google Play Store

We use **RevenueCat** to manage subscription and purchase status. RevenueCat may process:

* Anonymous purchase identifiers
* Transaction status
* App user ID (non-personally identifiable)

We do not store or process your payment information directly.

All billing data is handled by the respective app store according to their privacy policies.

 

## 3. How We Use Information

We use information only to:

* Provide and maintain app functionality
* Enable premium features
* Display advertisements (free version only)
* Improve app performance and stability

We do not sell personal data.

 

## 4. Data Storage and Security

The App is designed to operate locally on your device.

We do not maintain user databases containing personal information related to app usage.

We implement reasonable measures to protect the integrity and security of the App.

 

## 5. Data Sharing

We do not share personal information with third parties, except:

* Advertising partners (such as Google AdMob)
* Payment processors (Apple, Google Play)
* RevenueCat for purchase validation

These third parties operate under their own privacy policies.

 

## 6. Data Retention

Because we do not collect personal user accounts or personal data, we do not retain personal information.

Third-party services (AdMob, Apple, Google, RevenueCat) may retain data according to their own retention policies.

 

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed toward children under the age of 13 (or the minimum legal age in your jurisdiction).

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us.

 

## 8. International Users

If you use the App outside of Türkiye, please note that third-party services (such as AdMob or Apple) may process data in other countries.

By using the App, you consent to such processing in accordance with applicable laws.

 

## 9. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights regarding your data, including:

* The right to access information
* The right to request deletion
* The right to restrict processing

Since we do not directly collect personal data, most requests should be directed to the relevant third-party service provider (e.g., Google or Apple).

 

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.

Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
